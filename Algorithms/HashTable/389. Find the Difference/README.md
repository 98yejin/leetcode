# [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference)

```none
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.
```

## HashTable

Store the frequency of each character in s and t to the dictionaries ( use collections.Counter or make your own ).
And compare the frequency of characters in s and t.

## XOR

Calculating the ASCII value of the added letter directly without iterating through the entire string t.
Since XOR is commutative and associative, characters that are common in both strings will cancel out, leaving only the ASCII code of the added letter.
